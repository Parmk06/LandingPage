### Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

The following key tasks were accomplished:

1. **Building the Navigation Bar:** The `buildNavigationMenu` function was created, executed by a foreach loop, and supported by other helper methods to dynamically generate the navigation menu.

2. **Implementing Smooth Scroll Behavior:** The `scroll` event listener was utilized to achieve smooth scrolling between sections, enhancing the overall user experience.

3. **Identifying Active Section:** Functions using if statements and the `getBoundingClientRect` method were added to identify the section in the viewport and provide it with a special class (`your-active-class`). The corresponding link in the NavBar is also assigned an active class to highlight the selected section.

4. **Toggling NavBar Visibility:** A function was introduced to toggle the NavBar visibility based on user interaction with the webpage. The `scroll` event listener and the `setTimeout` method were employed for this purpose.

5. **Scroll to Top Button:** A "Scroll to Top" button was appended to the page footer using JS and CSS. This button enables users to easily return to the home page without manual scrolling.

#### Installation/Download

## Development
- **JS Version:** ES6
-**Node.js** v20.10.0

The project consists of four files:
